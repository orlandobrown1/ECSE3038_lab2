## Description of the Lab

    This Code was written for the purpose of a Lab and it consisted of 2 questions: 

Question 1. Write a function, update_todo_by_id(), that handles incoming PATCH requests from the demo site. The function should accept the ID of the todo that should be updated and a todo request object that has the desired changes. Your function should then search for the matching todo object in your todo list and update it with the received changes.

Question 2. Write a function, delete_todo_by_id(), that handles incoming DELETE requests from the demo site. The function should accept the ID of the todo that should be deleted. Your function should then search for the matching todo object in your todo list and remove it.


### My Favourite Pokemon 

Watchog is my favourite Pokemon!

WatchHog is an upright, meerkat-like Pok√©mon with large cheeks and a single, pointed incisor sticking out of its mouth. It is mainly reddish-brown with beige cheeks and neck. There is yellow striping on its chest and tail. Its hands, feet, and tail tip are white. Its red eyes have small black pupils and a yellow stripe. Black markings accentuate the eyes at their outer ends. Its tail is almost exclusively depicted standing up straight, although it can also be kept in a relaxed position.

There are luminescent compounds in Watchog's body that allow its stripes and eyes to glow. It uses this ability to threaten predators. Its cheeks can hold a large amount of seeds, which it collects and spits at its opponents. Watchog possess night vision and can view its surroundings in the darkness.
